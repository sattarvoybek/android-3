Submitting Patches
------------------

Patches are always welcome!  Please submit your patches via LineageOS Gerrit.
You can do this by using these commands:

    (From root android directory)
    . build/envsetup.sh
    (Go to repo you are patching, make your changes and commit)
    cmgerrit <for(new)/changes(patch set)> <branch/change-id>

    repo start nx .
    (Make your changes and commit)
    repo upload .

Note: "." means the current directory
For more help on using this tool, use this command: `repo help upload`

Make your changes and commit with a detailed message, starting with what you are working with (i.e. "vision: Update Kernel")
Commit your patches in a single commit. Squash multiple commits using this command: `git rebase -i HEAD~<# of commits>`


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/XNUBIA/LineageOS, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the XNUBAI/LineageOS trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/XNUBIA-Project/android.git -b xn

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
